# mini-projects

This repository will contain small projects I am making to better learn javascript and jquery. The ideas for these projects are from [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) [40 JavaScript Projects for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/) but with my own little changes. Instead of using plain javascript, I will be using jquery.
