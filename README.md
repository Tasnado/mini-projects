# mini-projects

This repository will contain small projects I am making to better learn javascript and jquery. The ideas for these projects are inspired by [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) 40 JavaScript Projects for Beginners article but with my own changes. Instead of using plain javascript, I will be using jquery. All the projects can be found at this [website](https://tasnia-projects.netlify.app/)
