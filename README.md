# mini-projects

This repository will contain small projects I am making to better learn javascript and jquery. The ideas for this project is from [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) [40 JavaScript Projects for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/). However, I will be using jquery instead of plain javascript.
